NLNOG RING servers
==================

MOTIVATION:
-----------

I've noticed that there are a lot of friendly 'shell access' exchange deals 
between dutch network operators. This makes it easier for parties to debug 
network issues and troubleshoot 'from the outside'. A point of view outside 
your network is absolutely essential, seeing what others see is a useful 
thing with a variety of network problems. Well known examples are 'it works 
for even numbered ip address, but not for odd numbered ip address via this 
and this route'. 

To encourage and provide a streamlined way of cooperating I introduce the
"NLNOG RING". In essence the deal is very simple: you donate a machine to
the ring, and you gain access on all servers which are part of the network,
hence the name "ring". 

A great example would be to launch a traceroute from 10 servers in different
networks and quickly get the results instead of waiting till somebody has
the time to run some tests for you.
