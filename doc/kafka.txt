# Kafka infrastructure

Kafka is used as a message queue for batched metrics aggregation (work in progress).

The only broker is compute02.infra.nlnog.net.

Ansible will not restart Kafka on configuration changes - a cold Kafka restart can
take a while, so it should be done manually.

    systemctl restart zookeeper  # only necessary if ZK configs were modified
    systemctl restart kafka

Restarting Kafka will lead to data loss for producers that have no buffer on their own.
Right now, there's no buffer-less producers, so restarting Kafka is safe.


## Working with Kafka

    sudo -u kafka -i

    # List topics
    kafka-topics.sh $ZP --list

    # Describe topic
    kafka-topics.sh $ZP --describe --topic test

    # Set topic retention (either by bytes or time)
    kafka-configs.sh $ZP --entity-type topics --entity-name test --alter --add-config retention.bytes=300000000000

    # Consume topic using the Java consumer (add --from-beginning for replay)
    kafka-console-consumer.sh $KP --topic test --partition 0

    # Produce to topic using the Java producer
    while : ; do date; sleep 1; done | kafka-console-producer.sh $KB --topic test --max-block-ms 500

## Working with kafkacat

kafkacat is a librdkafka-based client (rather than the Kafka Java clients). It's much
more friendly for doing advanced operations, like a consumer group or specifying offsets,
and most importantly, it's in the Ubuntu repos, so it can be easily used from other hosts.

    sudo -u kafka -i

    # Simple consumer (no consumer group), start at end, beginning or offset
    kafkacat -t test -o end
    kafkacat -t test -o beginning
    kafkacat -t test -o 1500
