# Machines that are unreachable for three months are automatically removed by
# the 'node_down_deactivation' cronjob. The details of removed machines are
# sent to root@dbmaster.infra.ring.nlnog.net

# The below steps are required to manually remove a machine from the ring

# Turn the node off
shutdown -h now

# Remove node(s) from database and dns

ring-pdns del node <name>
ring-admin delete machine <name>

# Mark all users for the participant as inactive

ring-admin deactivate participant <username>

# Done. Ansible will:
# - disable the user
# - move the 'ssh-keys' file to 'ssh-keys.disabled'
