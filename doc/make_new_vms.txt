We use libvirt to make VMs on the container nodes we've been given
by our sponsors.

Making a VM is straight forward, but at this moment not done
via ansible. You'll have to manually log in and create a VM to
your liking:

    $ ssh -XYA container07.infra.ring.nlnog.net
    $ sudo -E virt-manager

Make sure to attach the VM to the proper shared network bridge, usually this is
'virbr0' or 'virbr1'. Also make sure to flag the VM as 'autostart'.
