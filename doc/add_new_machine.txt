# These steps are required to add a machine to the ring

# Prequisites:

# check that the host has working ipv4 and ipv6 connectivity

# check if cpu is 64 bit - if not please report to the owner of the machine
# that we do not support 32 bit machines in the ring
lscpu

# DNS:

# Database (on the master):

ring-admin add machine $username $hostname $asnumber $countrycode $geo "$datacenter" $v4address $v6address [$statecode]

# update DNS of ring.nlnog.net so $org.ring.nlnog.net is a CNAME towards the fqdn of the node

ring-pdns add node <node> <v4> <v6> <geo>

# Puppet repo:

# generate config-snippets for the different puppet configs
# /etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp
ring-admin generate puppet node $hostname

# /etc/puppet/files/etc/hosts
ring-admin generate hostsfile $hostname

# /etc/puppet/manifests/ring-users.pp
ring-admin generate puppet user $username

# Setup AMP measuring
cd modules/amp/tools/
./create_files

git commit -am '<your message>'
git push && ssh master01.infra.ring.nlnog.net sudo ring-puppet-repo-sync

# On the host:

# replace $org with organization name
echo "$org01.ring.nlnog.net" > /etc/hostname
hostname -F /etc/hostname

# add /etc/hosts 
echo "78.152.42.69   master01 master01.infra.ring.nlnog.net puppet" >> /etc/hosts
echo "2a02:d28:666::69 master01 master01.infra.ring.nlnog.net puppet" >> /etc/hosts

# install puppet

apt-get -y install curl
curl https://ring.nlnog.net/ring.key | apt-key add -
curl https://ring.nlnog.net/sources.list > /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update; apt-get -y dist-upgrade; apt-get -y install puppet puppet-common

# run puppet until everything is up2date
puppetd --test; puppetd --test; puppetd --test

# logout; then log in as a ring-admin user
# if ring-admin users exist (for puppet has behaved well) you can delete 
# the rootpassword and clean up the nlnog install user. 
passwd --delete root
deluser --remove-home nlnog

# done!
# now is probably a good time for a reboot
reboot

# Finalize:

# Add the node to the nodes TXT record so it can be used by ring-users

ring-pdns activate node <node> <countrycode>

# Add the node to the google map (currently via Teun)

# More AMP stuff
#
# ssh worker03
# sudo su - postgres
# ./addcountry <countrycode> (if new)
# ./addnode <node> <countrycode>

# Done.
